    "**You have been hired! Congratulations. Your first task we have been experiencing issues with our coffee machine. Breakdown and theft. We will need you to build a virtual coffee machine that takes coins process it check the resource available for making  the coffee and if all checks are successful, it gives you your coffee . The application should prompt the user to make their coffee choice, prompt the user for the coins to be entered and process it. Check to see if the user has sufficient funds, after that check if there are sufficient resources to make the coffee. The program should keep running until the user shut it down.**\n"
